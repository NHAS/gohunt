                <p class="features_paragraph">
                    GoHunt allows you to find all kinds of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, including the often-missed blind XSS. The service works by hosting specialized XSS probes which, upon firing, scan the page and send information about the vulnerable page to the GoHunt service.
                    <br /><br />
                    Upon signing up you will create a special <code>{{ .Domain }}</code> short domain such as <code><i>yoursubdomain</i>.{{ .Domain }}</code> which identifies your XSS vulnerabilities and hosts your payload. You then use this subdomain in your XSS testing, using injection attempts such as <code>&#34;&#62;&#60;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#32;&#115;&#114;&#99;&#61;&#47;&#47;<i>yoursubdomain</i>&#46;{{ .Domain }}&#62;&#60;&#47;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#62;</code>. GoHunt will automatically serve up XSS probes and collect the resulting information when they fire.</p>

                    Easily manage all of your XSS payload fires in one spot! All vulnerabilities are recorded in your GoHunt control panel. Even the often-missed blind XSS payload fires which occur in other victim's browsers in place such as backend administrative panels, logging systems, and more are all recorded.

                    All GoHunt payloads work as probes to gather information on where they have fired. The following information is collected upon a payload firing:
                    <br /><br />
                    The vulnerable page's URI
                    <br />
                    Origin of Execution
                    <br />
                    The Victim's IP Address
                    <br />
                    The Page Referer
                    <br />
                    The Victim's User Agent
                    <br />
                    All Non-HTTP-Only Cookies
                    <br />
                    The Page's Full HTML DOM
                    <br />
                    Full Screenshot of the Affected Page
                    <br />
                    Responsible HTTP Request <i>(If an GoHunt compatible tool is used)</i>
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    GoHunt probes utilize the HTML5 canvas API to generate a full screenshot of the vulnerable page which an XSS payload has fired on. With this feature you can peak into internal administrative panels, support desks, logging systems, and other internal web apps. This allows for more powerful reports that show the full impact of the vulnerability to your client or bug bounty program.

                    <br />
                    XSS payload fires also send out detailed email reports which can be easily forwarded to the appropriate security contacts for easy reporting of critical bugs.

                    <br />
                    Upon registering for GoHunt you will get your own short domain for your XSS payloads which can be used on length-restricted input fields. No need to setup DNS or hosting!

                    <br />
                    Perhaps the most powerful feature of GoHunt is the ability to correlated injection attempts with XSS payload fires. By using an <a href="https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/xsshunter_client" target="_blank">GoHunt compatible testing tool</a> you can know immediately what caused a specific payload to fire (even weeks after the injection attempt was made!).
